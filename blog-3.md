Type guards in TypeScript help narrow down types at runtime, ensuring safe operations on variables. Common types include:

typeof for primitive types (string, number).
instanceof for class instances.
in to check properties in objects.
Custom guards for user-defined types. These checks reduce runtime errors and enhance type safety in complex scenarios.
